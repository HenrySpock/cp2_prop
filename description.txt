Proposal for Letâ€™s Go Castling!

App description: 

This will be a light social media app centered on travel/trips, allowing people to share posts about places they have visited or want to visit. It will be themed (but not exclusive) to medieval sites.

The app will provide social interactivity for friending, following, direct messaging, commenting and liking of posts.  

It will rely on Leaflet maps to display information about where users have been.
The main map (which you can see before logging in) populates the 5 most recent non-private entries for everyone to see. When a user registers and/or logs in, they will then see all posts made and can sort what they are seeing based on:
a slew of medieval types of site
a slew of non-medieval types of site
UNESCO sites
filming locations
video game locations

The app will provide an admin suite (that allows for handling of reported users with communication, warning, suspending, banning) and the ability to schedule site maintenance.

The 2 big things this app is not (besides not being Facebook or Twitter):
1. An image hosting site. 

2. The type of site where someone would post everything that comes into their head throughout the day. They *could* do that, but it would have to be attached to the details of a trip/visit somewhere.
